\partintrotitle{Introduction to the second chapter block}

In this second block of chapters, we cover the basic elements of optics that are used in both quantum and classical communication systems. Coherent light and lasers that can generate it are addressed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents interference and the concepts of phase and group velocities; here, interference is a specific concept in wave mechanics, rather than the use of the term to refer to e.g. noise that disrupts radio communications. Constructive and destructive interference patterns appear in light, and are also the heart of quantum computing algorithms, so this chapter may deepen your understanding of quantum algorithms as well.  Chapter 7 presents the geometric optics analysis of waveguides.  The most common form of waveguides, of course, is optical fiber, which forms the backbone of today's classical Internet.
